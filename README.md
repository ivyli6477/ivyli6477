# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
This is ivy. A **coder, creator & learner**.

I am expected to graduate from Columbia in December 2022 with a Master of Arts Degree in Quantitative Methods in Social Sciences under Data Science Track.

I have a strong interest in data analytics. Exploring data and the underlying connections between seemingly unrelated factors intrigue me like no other. I am fascinated by the process of visualizing data findings, sharing my knowledge with others, and facilitating decision-making.

Looking forward to connecting with you!
